					<h2>Version 3.50.0029 - April 2, 2003</h2>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:</b> Several fixes were made to handle the possibility of network drives being disconnected.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:</b> Using the Close All command, and then cancelling the &quot;Save Modified Files&quot; dialog box would sometimes leave Source&nbsp;Insight in a &quot;shut-down&quot; state, which would disable certain commands and stop background parsing.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:</b> Syntax Formatting was incorrect near the end of lines if the &quot;annotate closing braces&quot; options were enabled.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix: </b>Symbol Lookup sometimes failed due to a bug in the internal &quot;Missing Symbol Cache&quot;.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix: </b>C# Verbatim strings could cause symbols below them to not parse.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:</b> Project Settings for the &quot;Source&nbsp;Directory&quot; were sometimes corrupted due to a bug that did not resolve relative paths correctly.  This could lead to strange and incorrect names in the project's file list.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Change:</b> Long file path names are now trimmed down to show the first and last folder names in several dialog boxes and notice windows. This will allow you to read at least the most relavent file path information, instead of just truncating the name.</p>
					<h2>Version 3.50.0028 - March 12, 2003</h2>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:</b> Files could be truncated if the option to &quot;remove extra white space&quot; is enabled. It is strongly recommended that you upgrade to this version if you have <b>Options &gt;&nbsp;Preferences:&nbsp;Files:&nbsp;&quot;Remove extra white space when saving&quot;</b> enabled.</p>
					<h2>Version 3.50.0027 - March 7, 2003</h2>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:</b> Relation Window: The Relation Window was not expanding correctly when showing multiple references inside the same node box.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix: </b>Saving Files that contain lines longer than 2026 characters was corrupting the file and introducing new line breaks.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix: ASP/JSP/HTML:</b> Several bug fixes were made to how scripts were parsed and formatted. Also, a freezing bug was fixed in this area that could happen when typing in a script body.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix: Searching:</b> Fixed a bug that caused some regular expressions to freeze the program.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix: C#:</b> Some Verbatim strings were not parsed correctly.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix: Paste: </b>After pasting and using the UP or DOWN&nbsp;arrows, the horizontal position was kind of arbitrary.  Now when you use the UP&nbsp;or DOWN arrows after pasting, the cursor will move vertically from the position the cursor is in after the paste.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix: C++/Java/C#:</b> Symbol lookup was not finding members of a base class when the derived class was referred to with a namespace prefix.  For example:</p>
					<pre><font color="#006600">namespace NS
{
	class Base 
	{
		void member();	
	};

	class Derived : Base { };
};

NS::Derived d;
d.member(); // member was not being found in NS::Base
</font></pre>
					<p class="body"></p>
					<p class="body"><b>Change:</b> Replace command: After the replace operation, the original whole line-selection is restored. You can disable this with a new check box added to the <b>Options &gt;&nbsp;Preferences:&nbsp;Search</b> dialog.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>New:&nbsp;</b>Macro function:&nbsp;<b>AddFileListToProj</b> <b>( hprj, szListFileName)</b> - adds all the files listed in the given file to the project.</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p class="body"><i>hprj</i> is the project handle</p>
						<p class="body"><i>szListFileName</i> is a string containing the name of the list file.  The list file should be a text file containing one file name per line.  The file can also contain one directory per line, in which case the directory's contents are added to the project.</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p class="body"><b>New:&nbsp;</b>Macro function:&nbsp;<b>EmptyProj</b> <b>(hprj)</b> - empties the project by removing all files from the project. The files themselves are not deleted or affected.</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p class="body"><i>hprj</i> is the project handle</p>
					</blockquote>
					<h2>Version 3.50.0026 - February 10, 2003</h2>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:</b> ASP/JSP error parsing some server-side scripts.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:</b> Auto-complete window was not showing separate entries for overloaded functions.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:</b> Repainting bug when drawing the application background, which would cause the background to be drawn using the wrong color when the Style Properties dialog was up.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>New:&nbsp;</b>Preferences:&nbsp;Display option:&nbsp;&quot;Enable Animations&quot;.  This controls various window border animations that occur when you activate and roll-up some windows.  You may want to disable these animations if your video performance is too slow.</p>
					<h2>Version 3.50.0025 - February 7, 2003</h2>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:</b> Task switching into Source Insight could be slow when many files were open in Source&nbsp;Insight. Unnecessary formatting and redrawing was being done.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:</b>&nbsp;Java:&nbsp;Crashes in symbol lookup operations and displaying code.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:&nbsp;</b>Java Symbols:&nbsp;Display speed and general symbol lookup speed was increased for Java files. Some very slow situations were found and removed.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:</b> The symbol-lookup engine was not handling symbols that had embedded dots (.) in the name.  Normally symbols do not have dots in the name, but it is possible to create a custom parsing pattern that results in such a symbol name.  Source&nbsp;Insight stores symbol names internally in a &quot;dotted-name&quot; format, such as &quot;classname.membername&quot;.  </p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:&nbsp;</b>Pasting lines when the &quot;Smart Paste&quot; mode is on caused the lines to be re-tabbified.  This could result in some spaces appearing where there used to be tabs.  Now, if the paste does not need to alter the indentation of the line, the tabs in the line are not altered.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:&nbsp;</b>Pasting a whole line now moves the insertion point to the beginning of the next line, instead of the end of the new line.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:&nbsp;</b>HTML/ASP/XML parsing:  Attribute strings that spanned more than one line were not parsed correctly.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:&nbsp;</b>Symbol Lookup could result in a crash, especially in deeply nested blocks, or in Java with many import statements.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:&nbsp;</b>C/C++ parsing:&nbsp;Function declarations were not parsed if a struct was declared in the formal argument list.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix: </b>C++ parsing:&nbsp;In a class or struct, the member that followed the &quot;public:&quot; label was not being parsed correctly.  This was caused by a bogus entry for &quot;public&quot; in the c.tom file.  A new c.tom file is installed with this version.  If you don't want to accept this new c.tom file, then open &quot;My Documents\Source Insight\c.tom&quot; and find the line with &quot;public&quot; on a line by itself.  Delete that line.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:&nbsp;</b>C# parsing:&nbsp;Global Function declarations were not parsed (at the file scope).</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:&nbsp;</b>Auto-completion: the auto-completion list would fail to appear at times, even if the option was active.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:&nbsp;</b>Resource&nbsp;leak when docking and undocking windows.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:</b> Project Report:&nbsp;File name case was not being preserved in the project report.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:&nbsp;</b>The check mark on the menu item &quot;View &gt;&nbsp;Visible Tabs&quot; was not working correctly.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:&nbsp;</b>Minor adjustments to toolbar positioning.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Change:&nbsp;</b>Java: Nested package names now appear on one line in the symbol window pane, instead of showing a tree of package nodes.</p>
					<h2>Version 3.50.0023 - January 14, 2003</h2>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:</b> Crash Parsing HTML &amp; XML: Including CDATA sections inside of some HTML and XML files could cause the parser to crash.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:</b> HTML &amp; XML: Custom parsing patterns were not finding symbols in element tags.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:</b> Slowness in C/C++/Java/C#: Symbol lookup operations in some projects could be very slow, due to duplicate symbols being returned by the lookup engine.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:</b> Some dialog boxes did not display correctly in Asian versions of&nbsp;Windows. Notably, the Preferences multi-page dialog box was not sized large enough to display the font used in the dialog box.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix: </b>The styles used to display references to Java packages and namespaces were swapped.</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:&nbsp;</b>JSP script comments were not recognized. For example:</p>
					<p class="code">&lt;%-- this is a comment --%&gt;</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:&nbsp;</b>ASP/HTML/JSP script languages were not recognized in cases where version number was appended to the language name. For example:</p>
					<p class="code">&lt;script language=&quot;JavaScript2.0&quot;&gt;......&lt;/script&gt;</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:&nbsp;</b>Java: Initializer lists following a new array was not parsed correctly. For example:</p>
					<p class="code">static int[] newarray = new int[] { ...... };</p>
					<p class="body"><b>Fix:</b> Project Synchronizing could put up warning messages, even if the &quot;Suppress warning messages&quot;&nbsp;option was checked.</p>
